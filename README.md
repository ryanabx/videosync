Sync browser video content with friends!

VideoSync aims to become a browser extension supported by Chrome, Firefox, and Safari to sync any internet video playback with friends.

VideoSync will utilize WebRTC to communicate lightweight video commands such as `Play`, `Pause`, `Scrub`, and more!

The plan is to support Chrome and Firefox first, and then move on to Safari, and hopefully support iOS and Android browsers in the future!
